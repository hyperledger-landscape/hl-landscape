            description: >-
              Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases. It can also
              be ran on test networks such as Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Görli. Hyperledger Besu includes several consensus algorithms including PoW, and PoA (IBFT,
              IBFT 2.0, Etherhash, and Clique). Its comprehensive permissioning schemes are designed specifically for use in a consortium environment.

              Hyperledger Burrow is a complete single-binary blockchain distribution focussed on simplicity, speed, and developer ergonomics. It supports both
              EVM and WASM based smart contracts and uses BFT consensus via the Tendermint algorithm. It has a sophisticated event system and can maintain a
              relational database mapping of on-chain data. Governance and permissioning is built in and can be amended by on-chain proposal transactions. It is
              optimised for public permissioned proof-of-stake use cases but can also be used for private/consortium networks.
